# A tree falls in a P2P Network

2019-10-24

Philosophers often ask the following question:

> If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?

Can something exist without being perceived by consciousness?
It is a difficult question and like many philosophical questions we cannot 
really proof.

In an attempt to try to understand it and abstract it
to a level that I can easily reason about I use the analogy
of a Peer to Peer computer network.

Let us say that consciousness is experienced by individual peers
in the network, they are conscious of other peers and the overall
state of the network. The network is the existence or the universe of
the peers. Let us also assume that there is a single peer that is not
connected to the others and it represents the tree in the forest.

So the question is if the peer that's not connected to the others
performs some action (tree falling) did it really happen from the
perspective of the connected peers. We might be tempted to say yes 
the action happened because the question implies that it happed but 
I argue that to the peers who are not conscious of the action and the question
the action did not happen. The state of the network (existence) remains
unchanged it is not effected by the disconnected peer, in that network
the disconnected peer does not exist in the same sense as the other
peers, it exists simply as a possibility but human existence is
an infinite state structure the possibilities are infinite. 

The network is the collective consciousness of the connected peers
in other words our existence is a network of the consciousness of all
conscious beings.

But it raises the question of how disconnected peers connect to the
network or how we are able to be conscious of new phenomena, I believe
this is a fundamental property of consciousness it is mutable and
always has the possibility to acquire the unknown but until the
unknown is known it is just that unknown and unconceivable. The
P2P network by its design can acquire new peers but until then
they don't exist (in the network or in the periphery of the 
connected peers).

But does this imply multi universes, does the disconnected peer
exist in its own universe or does the falling tree exist in
its own universe. I say we cannot know that in the
same way that the peers cannot know if the disconnected peer exists.
