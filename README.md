# governance
These are thoughts, thoughts about governance and equity in the cryptospace. 
The idea for me is to create a open-source debate around the following models: 
Libertarian
Socialist
Marxist
Capitalist
Liberal 
And maybe to build a mixed way when it comes to governance in the cryptospace.
